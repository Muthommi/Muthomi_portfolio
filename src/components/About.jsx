          <h3>Building the Future, One API at a Time</h3>
          <p>
            I'm an aspiring backend engineer with a passion for creating scalable systems and writing clean, maintainable code. As a graduate of Africa Leadership Experience (ALX Africa), I've specialized in Python development, RESTful API design, and database architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love solving real-world problems through technology and am constantly growing my skills to stay at the forefront of backend development. My goal is to build systems that not only work efficiently but also make a meaningful impact.
